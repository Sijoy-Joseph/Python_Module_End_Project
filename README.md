This project is designed to analyze employee data for ABC Company. The dataset contains 458 rows and 5 columns representing information about employees across different teams. The goal of this project is to preprocess the dataset, perform data analysis, and present the findings with visualizations. The tasks include identifying trends in employee distribution, salary expenditure, and correlations in the dataset.

Tasks Completed
Preprocessing
Corrected the "height" column: The height data was corrected by replacing it with random values between 150 and 180 cm.
Analysis Tasks
Team Distribution: We determined the distribution of employees across different teams and calculated the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
Position Segregation: Employees were segregated based on their job positions (e.g., Developer, Manager, Lead).
Predominant Age Group: We identified the most common age group among the employees.
Salary Expenditure: We discovered which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
Correlation Between Age and Salary: We analyzed and visualized the correlation between employee age and salary.
Visualizations
For each of the analysis tasks, appropriate visualizations were created using matplotlib and seaborn to provide clear insights into the data.
